ðŸ§­ About This Dashboard

The Data Submission Dashboard provides a live overview of school-level data submission progress across districts and circuits. It consolidates information from multiple datasets â€” including successful logins, invalid logins, and data submission activity â€” into one unified view for easier monitoring and decision-making.

Key features include:

Real-Time Tracking: View which schools have completed learner, educator, and school pillar submissions.

Dynamic Filtering: Instantly filter results by district or circuit to focus on specific regions.

Automated Calculations: Completion percentages and progress indicators update automatically based on your current filter selection.

Visual Insights: Color-coded badges and progress bars make it easy to identify completion trends and areas requiring attention.

This dashboard is designed to support education administrators, district officials, and data teams in ensuring timely and accurate submission of school data.
